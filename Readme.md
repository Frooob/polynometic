# Polynometic - using genetic algorithms to approximate polynomials

In this project, I tried to use a genetic algorithm to approximate a polynomial of a given degree. 
The input is a cloud of measurement points, that is generated from an unknown polyinomial that is being added with normally distributed noise, 

All parameters can be set interactively with jupyter widgets.
